In this project, the use of sentiment analysis will be performed on data gathered from social media platforms, particularly whether the tweets gathered are positive, or negative. For the current study, a machine learning approach has been adopted, with the Logistic Regression model attaining the highest accuracy. They include a set of key research questions that the project aims to answer, which are the efficiency of various feature engineering approaches and the possibilities of applying sentiment analysis in business and organizational contexts. As such, this research contributes to the understanding of sentiment analysis through data preprocessing, data exploration, and model assessment. The final part of the project consists of tuning the complete approach and creating a Streamlit app where users can enter the text and get sentiment prediction as well as recommended options. Consequently, the studies underscore the need to perform sentiment analysis for tracking brand image as well as the public mood and present valuable business applications. Some suggestions for future research include a deeper analysis of other advanced deep learning techniques, enlarging the list of sentiment categories, and reflecting on the ethical issues connected with the use of sentiment analysis applications.
